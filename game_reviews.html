          <h2>DOOM Eternal</h2>
          <h3>Gameplay: 10/10</h3>
          <p>Doom Eternals gameplay is, in no uncertain terms, the most fun I have ever had with a videogame. The game forces you to adapt and overcome various different combat situations with different types and quantities of enemies every fight. Certain demons have weak points that you have to focus on to make fights easier. The game also allows you to spec into different perks, or different upgrades on each gun, allowing for a different build depending on your playstyle. The implementation of double jumps and dashes, along with other environmental hazards and movement tools, increase the options for what you can do to escape or attack. The recharging chainsaw is also an incredibly useful tool, I remember running out of ammo in DOOM 2016 being one of my biggest complaints about that game. This game also added many more glory kills which gives even more incentive other than the free health to finish them in that way.</p>
          <h3>Characters/Entities: 8/10</h3>
          <p>The characters themselves are nothing special, they tell a story, but the story itself isn’t incredibly interesting. Where the game really shines is the demons. Each one looks and functions in its own unique way providing different concerns with each, pushing the gameplay forward with increasing amounts of difficulty. The only demon I disliked was “The Marauder'', originally a boss, then later a regular demon that appears in the world. This enemy requires all of your attention and can only be attacked during its own attacking animation. The enemy feels very clunky and takes away from the fast paced gameplay. They are fine on their own, but completely interrupt the gameplay with other dangerous enemies around. </p>
          <h3>Story: 5/10</h3>
          <p>The Story for this game, though there is a bit explained through dialogue, is mostly explained through long log entries you can pick up throughout the game. All they really do is expand on the world, which is somewhat interesting, other than that it doesn’t really matter too much.</p>
          <h3>Soundtrack: 10/10</h3>
          <p>Doom Eternals soundtrack is exactly what you would expect, extreme heavy metal, and lots of it. The music’s pacing and sound makes tearing through the armies of hell give the feeling that everything is moving even faster than it already is.</p>
          <h3>Graphics/Style: 10/10</h3>
          <p>The game looks beautiful, and the world around it feels like hell, which is exactly how it’s supposed to feel. I have never had it drop below 144fps at 1440p on an RTX 2070 Super which adds to the smooth gameplay experience.</p>
          <h3>Overall: 43/50</h3>
