          <h2>LaTeX Milestone</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>I have put in a lot of time learning LaTeX for a good little while. LaTeX is a document editor mostly used by STEM majors for its incredible ease in writing equation heavy text. It also has some use by linguists and scholars writing in Sanskrit or Greek or other complex multilingual documents (at least, that's what Wikipedia says). I wrote up a few little projects and proofs to build some proficiency but didn't think I had the ability to try to write an entire assignment.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, my vector analysis professor happens to be awesome, so she sent me the .TeX file for a previous assignment she wrote. I used that and Google as reference material to write up my whole assignment. I feel like a million bucks and am hoping to make it a habit to write all my math assignments like this.</p>
          <p>The .TeX file for this assignment is posted at the end of this article to mark this milestone in my math career but also for any STEM major or curious person looking to get into LaTeX that wants to look over some sample code. Good luck, everyone, and remember to use , to give your terms some breathing room.</p>

          <h2>Year 2×3×337</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>I hope everyone had a very jolly holiday season. With the new year here, I wanted to put down some projects and goals I want to achieve.</p>
          <section class="intent-p">
            <h3>Make a History Podcast</h3>
            <p>This is something I have put off for way too long. I have been trying (but not really) to
              organize a podcast with my old high school history teacher, Mr. Sanborn, to talk about
              our thought on political history books and how our thoughts contrast with our own
              backgrounds.</p>
            <h3>Continue My Photography Account</h3>
            <p>I have a photography account on Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angels_cool_photos">@angels_cool_photos</a>, where I post photos
              that I take during my commutes or while I walk around with my friends. I have been
              pretty consistent with posting ever since I got my camera in September, but winter and
              early sunsets have really hampered my output lately. I am hoping to continue my
              photography adventures and keep posting as spring emerges.</p>
            <h3>Read More and Write My Thoughts About It</h3>
            <p>I read some great books in 2021. Some notable highlights were <i>The Trial, Norwegian
              Wood</i>, and <i>The Road to Wigan Pier</i>. I am hoping to substitute my time wasted online
              with more reading instead. I don't just wanna fill out a <i>Goodreads</i> profile though. I want
              to sit with my thoughts more and have something to say afterwards. That is why I am
              also trying to make myself write after reading to hopefully come up with more unified
              ideas about the book after putting pen to paper.</p>
            <h3>Learn Deutsch</h3>
            <p>I am probably going to Germany this summer to visit my history friend and go on
              a castle/ruins adventure, but I will sound like an idiot if I keep coasting along with my
              German studying. I have grammar books, vocab books, translation and frequency
              dictionaries, and German friends very willing to help me learn their language, but I have
              contended myself to just Duolingo to maintain my streak because I am too intimidated
              to restart actually learning my studies. <i>Ich bin sehr dumm.</i></p>
            <h3>Learn More Math</h3>
            <p>At the end of the day, I am an actuarial science student first and foremost. I need to
              keep forcing myself to perform well in my classes and, more importantly, learn about
              theory and proofs on my own time. I can't rely on my algebra and operation skills to be
              a mathematician just like I can't rely on knowing when to go at a traffic light to be a
              good driver.</p>
            <h3>Keep Posting on This Site</h3>
            <p>Last time I posted on here was like September, so I guess I need to fix that to organize
              my life a bit more and force myself to finish projects and post them on here.</p>
            <h3>Be More Productive</h3>
            <p>This is probably the most important goal on this list and ties in with all the others a lot. I am privileged to have access to so much information with professors, mentors, and
              friends to help inspire me to learn these things. I shouldn't use this time where I have so
              much freedom and opportunity wasting away watching YouTube or going on social
              media or any of these other time suckers. I have done my best to limit my social media
              and online use as much as possible while still having somewhat of a social life. I need to
              force myself to build up a larger amount of time before I lose focus. That is my biggest
              goal for this year: to make this year actually feel like an entire year instead of just a new
              number that I change on my dates every so often.</p>
          </section>

          <p>Well, hopefully writing this down will make me care more about all this. I hope my self-coercive
            language didn't give you the impression that I don't like doing any of these things. I love my hobbies and
            interests very much and have a lot of fun doing them. It's the first five minutes of trying to do them
            where I have difficulty. But like a car going seventy over a speedbump, I soar after those five minutes. I
            hope your year of 2*3*337 CE is awesome.</p>
