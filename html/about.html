        <p>Aspiring actor, protégé chess player, brand new father; none of these phrases describe Ángel Castañeda.</p>

        <p>The genuine me is a bit more boring. I am a twenty-year-old actuarial science (basically math) student from the state of Wisconsin. I work at my family's business as a tax preparer and notary.</p>

        <p>Math is my main passion. I am studying for exam P to get my future fellowship. I am also learning real analysis on my own and trying to build proficiency in LaTeX. Overleaf is king.</p>

        <p>Reading books is something I really enjoy. Classic literature and more recent fiction are my favorites. In 2021, I started writing reviews for some of the books I read that you can check out <a href="book-reviews.html">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Learning history is also something I do, especially from the 18th century to the present day. I am in the process of starting a podcast with my former history teacher about American political history, but please be patient. I am very good at delaying my projects with believable excuses. I am also really busy.</p>

        <p>I also like jazz, rock, photography, <a href="https://youtu.be/dUbx5TAKSdg?t=77">milksteak</a>, talking to passionate people, learning Deutsch, and burning my money on overpriced lenses and computer parts.</p>

        <p>Here is my site to occasionally post about what I do while cruising down life. Email me at <a href="mailto:angelaxel1420@gmail.com">angelaxel1420@gmail.com</a> in case you find an error or want me to clarify or discuss anything. <i>Prost! B-)</i></p>
