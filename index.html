          <h2>The Trial</h2>
          <p>Hello, everyone! I had the pleasure of reading <i>The Trial</i> (<i>Der Prozess</i> in Deutsch) by Franz Kafka last week, and it lives up entirely to its reputation of a dreary, esoteric tone. Something that <i>did</i> surprize me about the book was its readability. I had a rough experience with readability with my translation <i>The Metamorphosis</i>, Kafka's other most famous work, in high school, so I expected this book to be just as archaic and needlessly wordy, but no! Everything was simple to understand. The novel was never actually finished, so there are a few noticeable gaps in the narrative. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone that has the stomach to read gloomy books, especially now of all times.</p>
          <p>Warning! Spoiler ahead:<br />One of the first things I picked up on was how much I hated Josef K.. He was and arrogant chauvinist that justified his disgusting behavior with his own inflated ego. K. tried to act like a schemer vying to get his way, and I think that is what added to his defeat and the end of the novel. He kept thinking that he could overcome the court the same way he had risen in business, so he would keep making the wrong decisions in trying to deal with the court. He imagines the court to be a humanly thing that can be overcome with debate and persuassion, but this is crazy Kafka land where the court is this mystical entity that occupies every weird attic in the city and has some kind of tangential connection to every character near K. in the novel. What I think K. is going through in the novel is his acknowledgement of his guilt as a human being. The court sees him and all crimes across his life and cannot be reasoned with. He tried to get out of his dilemma as much as possible meeting three different lady friends on the way (I am not clever enough to figure out the meaning of those three women yet). K. is slowly becoming to the court as Block was to his lawyer. By the end of the novel, he is tired of fighting after a year of struggle: "There would be nothing heroic in resistance, in making trouble for these men, in trying to enjoy a final vestige of life by fighting back." The K. at the beginning of the novel would never have been so resigned to his fate The court had finally broken his spirits, and he had become a dog just like Block. He gets slaughtered with the knife (1914 Prague had no 8th amendment, I guess) and tried to find some kind of meaning or justification for his demise to comfort him but cannot. K. has his emotional climax (or abyss in this situation) when he sees that his failure is being watched by the figure in the window as he is being slaughtered. A truly disheartening book :-(</p>
          <p>I know my analysis is probably very surface level, but this is what I have been able to take from the book on my own. This is my blog, not yours, lol. I will likely write about the parable and the ladies in some coming weeks. If you agree or disagree with my take or have some wild card third thing to say, let me know! Email me whenever.</p>
